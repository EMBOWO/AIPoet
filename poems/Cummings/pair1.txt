[anyone lived in a pretty how town]

anyone lived in a pretty how town
(with up so floating many bells down)
spring summer autumn winter
he sang his didn’t he danced his did.

Women and men(both little and small)
cared for anyone not at all
they sowed their isn’t they reaped their same
sun moon stars rain

children guessed(but only a few
and down they forgot as up they grew
autumn winter spring summer)
that noone loved him more by more

when by now and tree by leaf
she laughed his joy she cried his grief
bird by snow and stir by still
anyone’s any was all to her

someones married their everyones
laughed their cryings and did their dance
(sleep wake hope and then)they
said their nevers they slept their dream

stars rain sun moon
(and only the snow can begin to explain
how children are apt to forget to remember
with up so floating many bells down)

one day anyone died i guess
(and noone stooped to kiss his face)
busy folk buried them side by side
little by little and was by was

all by all and deep by deep
and more by more they dream their sleep
noone and anyone earth by april
wish by spirit and if by yes.

Women and men(both dong and ding)
summer autumn winter spring
reaped their sowing and went their came
sun moon stars rain

BREAK

(because the moon is not ashamed of lovers)

because the moon is not ashamed of lovers—
she slips silver thighs through blinds
& tiptoes (barefoot) across
bedsheets,
folding herself into the pulse
between heartbeat and hush.

i saw you—(not seeing me
but being
so utterly you)
and the earth tilted its breath
to listen.

who needs clocks
when time is a petal curling inward,
when minutes melt
like snowflakes down
a collarbone?

(yes—you are the punctuation
my silence forgot it needed)

when we walk, the sidewalk
(forgets it's concrete)
becomes a soft hymn
of footsteps & almosts,
and maybe
the lampposts blush a little.

i love you not in thunder
but in
paper cranes—folded slow,
each wing a maybe
each crease a yes.

the stars are bad spellers
(they misspell your name as forever)
but it’s close enough
& anyway—grammar is a poor excuse
not to feel.

do you remember
when rain fell
upward?
(that’s how i knew it was you)
when the trees bent
toward our laughter
like worshippers
of something real.

and if i am lost—let it be
in the parenthesis of your arms
(where meaning is optional
but presence is everything)

because the moon is not ashamed of lovers—
so why should we
(ever
ever)
be?
