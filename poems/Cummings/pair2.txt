("If you can't eat you got to...")

If you can't eat you got to

smoke and we aint got
nothing to smoke:come on kid

let's go to sleep
if you can't smoke you got to

Sing and we aint got

nothing to sing;come on kid
let's go to sleep

if you can't sing you got to
die and we aint got

Nothing to die,come on kid

let's go to sleep
if you can't die you got to

dream and we aint got
nothing to dream(come on kid

Let's go to sleep)

BREAK

(the sun is a whisper)

the sun is a whisper(in your ear)
& blades of grass dream sideways
while puddles think in moons—

time—dribbles (down a sidewalk
like spilled paint—
children’s laughter smeared across sky)

oh! if hands could juggle light,
they’d catch tomorrow—
in a raindrop’s blink

kiss me—
not with lips
but with commas, semicolons:
syntax of skin

(i told the wind your name
& it unraveled
into dandelion confetti

—blown)

still, the stars
(keep mispronouncing us)
