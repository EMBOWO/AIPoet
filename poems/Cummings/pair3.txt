["Though Your Sorrows Not]

"though your sorrows not
any tongue may name,
three i'll give you sweet
joys for each of them
But it must be your"
whispers that flower

murmurs eager this
"i will give you five
hopes for any fear,
but it Must be your"
perfectly alive
blossom of a bliss

"seven heavens for
just one dying,i'll
give you" silently
cries the(whom we call
rose a)mystery
"but it must be Your"

BREAK

(love is a sideways falling star)

love is a sideways falling star
(not meant to land)
but oh—how it kisses the dark

you breathe in
parentheses
and exhale
commas

the trees forgot
their names
when you passed by

even the clocks
sigh(tick)
when you're near

& i—
am just a word
waiting
for your
voice

(yes. always yes)
