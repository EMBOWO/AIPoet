("this(let's remember)day...")

this(let's remember)day died again and
again;whose golden,crimson dooms conceive

an oceaning abyss of orange dream

larger than sky times earth:a flame beyond
soul immemorial forevering am—
and as collapsing that grey mind by wave
doom disappeared,out of perhaps(who knows?)

eternity floated a blossoming

BREAK

(sky isn’t blue—it remembers)

sky isn’t blue—it remembers
your eyes (before
they closed)

and birds don’t sing—they
spell
your name in
wingbeats

i tried to forget
you
but even silence
whispers
in
parentheses

(—come back
come
back
come
)
