[the bigness of cannon]

the bigness of cannon
is skilful,
 
but i have seen
death’s clever enormous voice
which hides in a fragility
of poppies. . . .
 
i say that sometimes
on these long talkative animals
are laid fists of huger silence.
 
I have seen all the silence
filled with vivid noiseless boys
 
at Roupy
i have seen
between barrages,
 
the night utter ripe unspeaking girls.

BREAK

(spring fell into your mouth)

spring fell into your mouth
—softly—
like a leaf that forgot to land

i watched your smile
grow roots
(in my ribcage)

clouds paused
just to learn your name

you speak in
colors (no eye can see)
& i—
a humble
parenthesis
around your
maybe

kiss me
like rain
that never asks
permission
