("your homecoming will be my...")

your homecoming will be my homecoming-

my selves go with you,only i remain;
a shadow phantom effigy or seeming

(an almost someone always who's noone)

a noone who,till their and your returning,
spends the forever of his loneliness
dreaming their eyes have opened to your morning

feeling the stars have risen through your skies:

so,in how merciful love's own name,linger
no more than selfless i can quite endure
the absence of that moment when a stranger
takes in his arms my very life who's your

-when all fears hopes beliefs doubts disappear.
Everywhere and joy's perfect wholeness we're

nobody knows the shape of always
(it might be your hand

or a sigh tucked
into a teacup,
where steam remembers
the curl of your name—

leaves fell
in perfect disorder
(as if autumn
had read your mind)

you smiled,
and all the wrongs in the world
paused—
to be briefly beautiful

i do not love you
(i become love
when you blink)

& time?
a fool—
trying to measure
the infinite
between
our fingertips
