I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,

I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treading - treading - till it seemed
That Sense was breaking through -

And when they all were seated,
A Service, like a Drum -
Kept beating - beating - till I thought
My mind was going numb -

And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul
With those same Boots of Lead, again,
Then Space - began to toll,

As all the Heavens were a Bell,
And Being, but an Ear,
And I, and Silence, some strange Race,
Wrecked, solitary, here -

And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
And I dropped down, and down -
And hit a World, at every plunge,
And Finished knowing - then -

BREAK

A Whisper in the Dust

I heard a whisper — in the Dust —
A syllable — of Air —
It brushed the Cedar’s rustled Robe —
And vanished — unaware —

It might have been — a Ghost’s reply —
Or just — the Clover’s Sigh —
Yet in its Tone — Eternity —
Was nestled — like a Lie —

I chased it — down the meadow’s spine —
It darted — through the Trees —
And left me — with a Thimble full —
Of haunted Mysteries —

I never caught — its Name —
Nor knew — what Truth it bore —
But still — I sit — beside the Breeze —
And listen — evermore —
