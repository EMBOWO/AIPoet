The Soul has Bandaged moments -

The Soul has Bandaged moments -
When too appalled to stir -
She feels some ghastly Fright come up
And stop to look at her -

Salute her, with long fingers -
Caress her freezing hair -
Sip, Goblin, from the very lips
The Lover - hovered - o'er -
Unworthy, that a thought so mean
Accost a Theme - so - fair -

The soul has moments of escape -
When bursting all the doors -
She dances like a Bomb, abroad,
And swings opon the Hours,

As do the Bee - delirious borne -
Long Dungeoned from his Rose -
Touch Liberty - then know no more -
But Noon, and Paradise

The Soul's retaken moments -
When, Felon led along,
With shackles on the plumed feet,
And staples, in the song,

The Horror welcomes her, again,
These, are not brayed of Tongue -

The Lantern in the Fog

A Lantern in the Fog — I saw —
It wobbled — like a Star —
Yet Stars have never stepped so near —
Nor wandered — quite so far —

It bobbed — as if a Hand — unseen —
Did bear it — through the Gray —
The Path was lost — the Compass — dim —
And yet — it led the Way —

Perhaps — it was a Dream — alight —
Escaping from the Mind —
Or else — a Thought — too bold — to stay —
That left the World — behind —

I followed it — until the Morn —
Had filtered through the Sky —
And there — the Lantern — bowed to Dawn —
And vanished — like a Lie —
