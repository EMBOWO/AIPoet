I'm Nobody! Who are you?

I'm Nobody! Who are you?
Are you - Nobody - too?
Then there's a pair of us!
Dont tell! they'd banish us - you know!
 
How dreary - to be - Somebody!
How public - like a Frog -
To tell your name - the livelong June -
To an admiring Bog!

BREAK

A Single Bee — in June

A single Bee — in June —
Did hum a solemn Tune —
As if the Clover’s breath —
Could resurrect from Death —

I paused — to catch its Song —
But Silence — held me long —
And Summer — hurried on —
