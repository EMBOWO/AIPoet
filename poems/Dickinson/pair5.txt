The Props assist the House

The Props assist the House
Until the House is built
And then the Props withdraw
And adequate, erect,
The House support itself
And cease to recollect
The Augur and the Carpenter –
Just such a retrospect
Hath the perfected Life –
A Past of Plank and Nail
And slowness – then the scaffolds drop
Affirming it a Soul –

I Met a Cloud Today

I met a Cloud — today —
It neither spoke — nor stayed —
But drifted past — as if to say —
The World is best — delayed —

It wore a shawl of Mist —
And shoes of silver Rain —
Departing — with a wistful twist —
It never came — again —
