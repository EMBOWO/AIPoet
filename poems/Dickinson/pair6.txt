Come slowly – Eden!

Come slowly – Eden!
Lips unused to Thee –
Bashful – sip thy Jessamines –
As the fainting Bee –

Reaching late his flower,
Round her chamber hums –
Counts his nectars –
Enters – and is lost in Balms.

The Sparrow took a Slice of Sky

The Sparrow took a Slice of Sky —
And vanished — in the Blue —
As if the Heavens held a Door —
That only Sparrows — knew —
