If-ing

If I had some small change
I’d buy me a mule,
Get on that mule and
Ride like a fool.
 
If I had some greenbacks
I’d buy me a Packard,
Fill it up with gas and
Drive that baby backward.
 
If I had a million
I’d get me a plane
And everybody in America’d
Think I was insane.
 
But I ain’t got a million,
Fact is, ain’t got a dime—
So just by if-ing
I have a good time!

Harlem Night Song

The moon don’t rise for everyone—
but I still hum my tune.
I walk these streets with tired shoes
and dreams beneath the moon.

They call me low, they call me lost,
but I still stand up tall.
My voice is hoarse from singing hope
that echoes past the wall.

I ain’t the man they wrote about—
but I’m the one who stays.
Holding light in dusky hands
through long and bitter days.
