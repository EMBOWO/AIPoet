Lover's Return

Ma old time daddy
Came back home last night.
His face was pale an'
His eyes didn't look just right.

He says to me, "I'm
Comin' home to you—
So sick an' lonesome
I don't know what to do."

	Oh, men treats women
	Just like a pair o' shoes.
	You men treats women
	Like a pair o' shoes—
	You kicks 'em round an'
	Does 'em like you choose.

I looked at ma daddy—
Lawd! an' I wanted to cry.
He looked so thin—
Lawd! that I wanted to cry.
But de devil told me:
	Damn a lover
	Comes home to die!

BREAK

Beneath This Skin

I’ve walked through shadows deep and wide,
With nowhere safe my soul could hide.
They told me, “Boy, you wait your turn,”
But I got fire the world can’t burn.

My hands have built what others own,
My back has bent for seeds not sown.
Still I rise with morning light,
Carrying dreams through endless night.

Ain’t no chain can hold my song,
Ain’t no lie can last that long.
I’m Black, I’m bold, I’m tired, I’m free—
America’s mirror looks like me.

I laugh, I cry, I live, I strive—
Still breathing. Still Black. Still alive.
