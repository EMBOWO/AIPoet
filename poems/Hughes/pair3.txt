Crowing Hen Blues

I was setting on the hen-house steps
When the hen begin to crow.
Setting on the hen-house steps
When the hen begin to crow.
I ain't gonna set on
Them hen-house steps no mo'!

I had a cat, I called him
Battling Tom McCann.
Had a big black cat, I called him
Battling Tom McCann.
Last night that cat riz up and
Started talking like a man.

Table for One

They set the table, white and wide,
But left no seat for me inside.
I knock. They hush. I wait. They stare.
But still, I pull up my own chair.

I eat the crumbs, then bake my bread,
Raise my voice for the silent dead.
You might not see me in your plan—
But I’m America. Yes, I am.
