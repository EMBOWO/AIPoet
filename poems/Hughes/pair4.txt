Brass Spittoons

Clean the spittoons, boy.
      Detroit,
      Chicago,
      Atlantic City,
      Palm Beach.
Clean the spittoons.
The steam in hotel kitchens,
And the smoke in hotel lobbies,
And the slime in hotel spittoons:
Part of my life.
      Hey, boy!
      A nickel,
      A dime,
      A dollar,
Two dollars a day.
      Hey, boy!
      A nickel,
      A dime,
      A dollar,
      Two dollars
Buy shoes for the baby.
House rent to pay.
Gin on Saturday,
Church on Sunday.
      My God!
Babies and gin and church
And women and Sunday
All mixed with dimes and
Dollars and clean spittoons
And house rent to pay.
      Hey, boy!
A bright bowl of brass is beautiful to the Lord.
Bright polished brass like the cymbals
Of King David’s dancers,
Like the wine cups of Solomon.
      Hey, boy!
A clean spittoon on the altar of the Lord.
A clean bright spittoon all newly polished—
At least I can offer that.
      Com’mere, boy!

A Dream Still Waiting

I heard them say,
“The dream is dead.”
But I seen it—
Ragged, hungry,
Limping down a dusty road
With no shoes on its feet,
Still moving.

I heard them say,
“There’s no more room.”
But I seen it—
Pressed against glass,
Looking in at gold and laughter,
And still knockin’.

They dress it up for some folks:
Stars and stripes,
Hope in neon lights.
But for me,
It comes in secondhand coats
And bus rides too long to count.

Still—
That dream don’t quit.
It hums like Grandma’s hymn,
Soft and stubborn,
Through jail bars and broken schools,
Through sweatshops and shotgun shacks.

It’s tired, sure—
But it ain’t dead.
It just ain’t been fed.
So I carry it,
Pocket-worn and stubborn,
Like a song I ain’t ready
To stop singin’ yet.
