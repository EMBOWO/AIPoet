Daybreak in Alabama

When I get to be a colored composer
I'm gonna write me some music about
Daybreak in Alabama
And I'm gonna put the purtiest songs in it
Rising out of the ground like a swamp mist
And falling out of heaven like soft dew
I'm gonna put some tall tall trees in it
And the scent of pine needles
And the smell of red clay after rain
And long red necks
And poppy colored faces
And big brown arms
And the field daisy eyes
Of black and white black white black people
And I'm gonna put white hands
And black hands and brown and yellow hands
And red clay earth hands in it
Touching everybody with kind fingers
Touching each other natural as dew
In that dawn of music when I
Get to be a colored composer
And write about daybreak
In Alabama.

BREAK

Steel and Smoke

I came up hard—
Brick dust in my lungs,
Steel in my hands,
And dreams too loud to hush.

Mama washed floors
Till her knees forgot rest,
Daddy swung hammers
With pain in his chest.

The bosses smiled
With their neckties tight,
While we bled hope
Through the factory night.

But I got poems
In these calloused palms,
Songs that rise
Through sirens and Psalms.

I ain’t rich,
But I own my name.
Ain’t bowed my head—
Ain’t played that game.

They build their towers
With backs like mine,
But I build visions
That outlast time.

You can lock the gate,
Draw the line in chalk—
I’ll still be here,
With my pride and talk.

America sings
With a voice like mine—
Rough and real,
And right on time.
