I’m all alone in this world, she said,
Ain’t got nobody to share my bed,
Ain’t got nobody to hold my hand—
The truth of the matter’s
I ain’t got no man.

Big Boy opened his mouth and said,
Trouble with you is
You ain’t got no head!
If you had a head and used your mind
You could have me with you
All the time.

She answered, Babe, what must I do?

He said, Share your bed—
And your money, too.

BREAK

Brown Skin, Bright Fire

I ain’t your shadow,
I’m the sun you try to shade.
Got brown skin wrapped in struggle,
But my soul ain’t ever fade.

I’ve danced in streets
That knew my pain,
Laughed through storms,
And sang in rain.

You can call me less,
Say I don’t belong—
But I’ve been rising,
All along.

From cotton fields
To city lights,
I carry dreams
That burn through nights.

Still here.
Still Black.
Still full of fight.
