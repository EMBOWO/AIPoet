The Snowman on the Moor

Stalemated their armies stood, with tottering banners:
She flung from a room
Still ringing with fruit of insults and dishonors

And in fury left him
Glowering at the coal-fire: "Come find me"—her last taunt.
He did not come

But sat on, guarding his grim battlement.
By the doorstep
Her winter-beheaded daisies, marrowless, gaunt,

Warned her to keep
Indoors with politic goodwill, not haste
Into a landscape

Of stark wind-harrowed hills and weltering mist;
But from the house
She stalked intractable as a driven ghost

Across moor snows
Pocked by rook-claw and rabbit-track: she must yet win
Him to his knees—

BREAK

Glass Hive

The mirror splits me like a surgeon’s tongue—
Clean, deliberate. Morning peels
Its silver skin, and I
Am a wasp in the glass hive, buzzing
For meaning.

Mother's hands float in the sink—
Detached saints, red-knuckled, praying
To scalded soap and silence.

I have eaten the dark,
Its velvet husk crushed on my teeth.
Father looms in ash—still, stern
With lips sewn shut by thunder.

The moon glares through my ribcage,
White eye of judgment.

All I birth is static.
All I hold turns
To smoke.

See how the light dismembers
Even this hope.
