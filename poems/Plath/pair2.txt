Daddy

You do not do, you do not do   
Any more, black shoe
In which I have lived like a foot   
For thirty years, poor and white,   
Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.

Daddy, I have had to kill you.   
You died before I had time——
Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,   
Ghastly statue with one gray toe   
Big as a Frisco seal

And a head in the freakish Atlantic   
Where it pours bean green over blue   
In the waters off beautiful Nauset.   
I used to pray to recover you.
Ach, du.

In the German tongue, in the Polish town   
Scraped flat by the roller
Of wars, wars, wars.
But the name of the town is common.   
My Polack friend

Says there are a dozen or two.   
So I never could tell where you   
Put your foot, your root,
I never could talk to you.
The tongue stuck in my jaw.

It stuck in a barb wire snare.   
Ich, ich, ich, ich,
I could hardly speak.
I thought every German was you.   
And the language obscene

An engine, an engine
Chuffing me off like a Jew.
A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.   
I began to talk like a Jew.
I think I may well be a Jew.

The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna   
Are not very pure or true.
With my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck   
And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack
I may be a bit of a Jew.

I have always been scared of you,
With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.   
And your neat mustache
And your Aryan eye, bright blue.
Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——

Not God but a swastika
So black no sky could squeak through.   
Every woman adores a Fascist,   
The boot in the face, the brute   
Brute heart of a brute like you.

You stand at the blackboard, daddy,   
In the picture I have of you,
A cleft in your chin instead of your foot   
But no less a devil for that, no not   
Any less the black man who

Bit my pretty red heart in two.
I was ten when they buried you.   
At twenty I tried to die
And get back, back, back to you.
I thought even the bones would do.

But they pulled me out of the sack,   
And they stuck me together with glue.   
And then I knew what to do.
I made a model of you,
A man in black with a Meinkampf look

And a love of the rack and the screw.   
And I said I do, I do.
So daddy, I’m finally through.
The black telephone’s off at the root,   
The voices just can’t worm through.

If I’ve killed one man, I’ve killed two——
The vampire who said he was you   
And drank my blood for a year,
Seven years, if you want to know.
Daddy, you can lie back now.

There’s a stake in your fat black heart   
And the villagers never liked you.
They are dancing and stamping on you.   
They always knew it was you.
Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I’m through.

BREAK

The Bone Orchard

The sky is a cauterized wound—
no stars, only stitches of light
holding back the hemorrhage.
I walk beneath it,
a relic in red boots,
my breath making ghosts
of the trees.

Mother, your apron still hangs
on the kitchen hook,
spotted like a lamb’s heart.
You taught me how to slice silence—
thin, pale ribbons of it
curling under the knife.
I swallowed them all.

The house groans like a god
remembering its sin.
In the bedroom, the wallpaper peels—
a sunburnt girl shedding her skin
with no one to watch.
She screams in paper curls.

I find myself again
in the attic mirror,
that cruel rectangle
full of women who never blink.
My face:
a cathedral abandoned to crows,
a chandelier drowned in milk.
I apply my lipstick like a wound.
The color of confession.

Father—
You died before my mouth
formed its first betrayal.
You are the silence I sip
like sacrament,
the ink in my poems,
the shadow that sharpens my bones.

The dolls have cracked porcelain mouths.
They whisper to one another
in dead languages.
I listen,
the good daughter,
cradling their secrets like embryos.

Outside, the orchard grows
only bones.
Femurs like branches.
Ribcages like birdnests.
The wind hums lullabies
to the spine trees,
and something moves beneath the soil—
a mothering rot.

I tried to become the sun once,
burning from the inside
with the fever of men.
But they only wanted
my silence,
my sweet compliance,
my wrists like crossed cutlery
at the dinner table.

Love is a scalpel.
It slices me open
and calls the bleeding holy.
I lie back and let it.
They say this is feminine.

In my womb,
a winter chapel.
No bells,
no cries.
Only snow,
falling inwards.

At night I dream of drowning
in a dress made of feathers,
my mouth filled with songbirds
too dead to sing.
I float like Ophelia,
if she’d worn combat boots
and a red mouth
and knew the names
of all her ghosts.

I do not rise
like some paper phoenix.
I crawl out of myself,
slow as molasses in frost.
My skin—a wet dress.
My soul—a bruised plum.

There is no salvation here.
Only the mirror,
the blade,
the bone orchard.
Only the truth
that blooms in decay.

I offer my heart
on a white plate.
It does not beat.
It does not bleed.
But oh,
how it shines.
