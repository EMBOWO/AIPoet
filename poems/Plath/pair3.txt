Elm

I know the bottom, she says. I know it with my great tap root:   
It is what you fear.
I do not fear it: I have been there.

Is it the sea you hear in me,   
Its dissatisfactions?
Or the voice of nothing, that was your madness?

Love is a shadow.
How you lie and cry after it
Listen: these are its hooves: it has gone off, like a horse.

All night I shall gallop thus, impetuously,
Till your head is a stone, your pillow a little turf,   
Echoing, echoing.

Or shall I bring you the sound of poisons?   
This is rain now, this big hush.
And this is the fruit of it: tin-white, like arsenic.

I have suffered the atrocity of sunsets.   
Scorched to the root
My red filaments burn and stand, a hand of wires.

Now I break up in pieces that fly about like clubs.   
A wind of such violence
Will tolerate no bystanding: I must shriek.

The moon, also, is merciless: she would drag me   
Cruelly, being barren.
Her radiance scathes me. Or perhaps I have caught her.

I let her go. I let her go
Diminished and flat, as after radical surgery.   
How your bad dreams possess and endow me.

I am inhabited by a cry.   
Nightly it flaps out
Looking, with its hooks, for something to love.

I am terrified by this dark thing   
That sleeps in me;
All day I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity.

Clouds pass and disperse.
Are those the faces of love, those pale irretrievables?   
Is it for such I agitate my heart?

I am incapable of more knowledge.   
What is this, this face
So murderous in its strangle of branches?——

Its snaky acids hiss.
It petrifies the will. These are the isolate, slow faults   
That kill, that kill, that kill.

BREAK

Chrysalis Ward

I sleep in a room of pale machines—
white serpents hissing lullabies
through my veins.
The ceiling flickers,
a cold eye that never blinks.
Nurses glide like moths,
their hands smelling of bleach and forgetting.

My body is a locked drawer.
The key was swallowed
by a girl with ink in her lungs
and prayers stitched to her tongue.
She lived here once—
I feel her pulse in the floorboards,
in the hum of fluorescent crucifixes.

There are no windows.
Only portraits of gods
with rusted crowns
and a calendar that weeps
in reverse.

Mother visits in perfume and silence.
She waters the orchid
on my sill,
its petals yellow as nicotine.
She does not ask
what I have become.
She only smooths my sheets
like she smoothed lies over bruises.

The mirror is cruel—
a coffin glass,
reflecting the ghost in my hospital gown.
I smile
and watch it crack.

My thoughts come in feathers,
black and brittle,
scratched onto prescription slips
and left to scatter.
They collect in my throat—
a nest of warnings
I dare not sing.

I remember the blood moon—
how it hung, fat and ripe,
over the garden where
I buried my girlhood
like a sin.
Its roots twist under my ribs now,
blossoming grief.

I am chrysalis—
not woman, not worm.
Something in-between.
Waiting.

I will not be reborn
clean.

I will come back
with teeth.
