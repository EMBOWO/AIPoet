Ariel

Stasis in darkness.
Then the substanceless blue   
Pour of tor and distances.

God’s lioness,   
How one we grow,
Pivot of heels and knees!—The furrow

Splits and passes, sister to   
The brown arc
Of the neck I cannot catch,

N*gger-eye   
Berries cast dark   
Hooks—

Black sweet blood mouthfuls,   
Shadows.
Something else

Hauls me through air—
Thighs, hair;
Flakes from my heels.

White
Godiva, I unpeel—
Dead hands, dead stringencies.

And now I
Foam to wheat, a glitter of seas.   
The child’s cry

Melts in the wall.   
And I
Am the arrow,

The dew that flies
Suicidal, at one with the drive   
Into the red

Eye, the cauldron of morning.

BREAK

Needlework

My fingers stitch silence into the hem
of another blank morning. The thread—
red as apology—snags on bone.

The kettle screams like a woman
left too long alone.

I sip shadows from chipped china,
taste the ash of old pronouns.

Mother’s ghost hums in the linoleum.
Her lullabies curdle the air.

In the mirror, I rehearse stillness—
mouth a tight wound,
eyes twin winter fields.

I am becoming
an heirloom of ache,
a pressed thing, pinned under
glass and time.

Even the light avoids me.

Even the walls
breathe without trust.

Needle in hand,
I sew myself shut.
