A Lesson in Vengeance

In the dour ages
Of drafty cells and draftier castles,
Of dragons breathing without the frame of fables,
Saint and king unfisted obstruction's knuckles
By no miracle or majestic means,

But by such abuses
As smack of spite and the overscrupulous
Twisting of thumbscrews: one soul tied in sinews,
One white horse drowned, and all the unconquered pinnacles
Of God's city and Babylon's

Must wait, while here Suso's
Hand hones his tacks and needles,
Scourging to sores his own red sluices
For the relish of heaven, relentless, dousing with prickles
Of horsehair and lice his horny loins;

White there irate Cyrus
Squanders a summer and the brawn of his heroes
To rebuke the horse-swallowing River Gyndes:
He split it into three hundred and sixty trickles
A girl could wade without wetting her shins.

Still, latter-day sages,
Smiling at this behavior, subjugating their enemies
Neatly, nicely, by disbelief or bridges,
Never grip, as their grandsires did, that devil who chuckles
From grain of the marrow and the river-bed grains.

The Altar Room

They dress me in white,
though I am no bride.
My vows were burnt
in the mouths of sparrows.
This veil—it is fog,
a soft suffocation.

The morning clatters
like bones in the sink.
My wrists bloom quietly
beneath the cuffs.
Nothing is sacred
but silence.

Father lives in the clock now,
ticking his sermons
in Morse code.
Each hour strikes
like a match on my spine.

I lay my organs
on the kitchen table—
heart, liver, lung—
neatly, as recipes.

What they take,
they call cleansing.
What I lose,
they name virtue.

The moon hovers
like an incision,
white and precise.

I pray to no god
but the mirror.
It answers:
You were always hollow.
You were always flame.

By night, I am smoke.
By morning, soot.

And yet—
something writhes
in the ash,
a breath not yet
buried.
