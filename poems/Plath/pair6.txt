Widow

Widow. The word consumes itself—
Body, a sheet of newsprint on the fire
Levitating a numb minute in the updraft
Over the scalding, red topography
That will put her heart ou like an only eye.

Widow. The dead syllable, with its shadow
Of an echo, exposes the panel in the wall
Behind which the secret passage lies—stale air,
Fusty remembrances, the coiled-spring stair
That opens at the top onto nothing at all . . .

Widow. The bitter spider sits
And sits in the center of her loveless spokes.

BREAK

Still Life with Knives

The fruit rots sweetly
in its silver bowl—
bruised like a confession.
Flies crown it
with their small hallelujahs.

My hands are obedient,
folded like napkins
beside the cutlery.
Each knife gleams
with inherited silence.

I breathe the wallpaper's pattern—
roses drowning
in formaldehyde.

There is no clock here,
only the slow
drip
of forgetting.

Outside, the sun
guts the trees
with gold.

Inside,
I hold still
as a painting
no one wants
to name.
