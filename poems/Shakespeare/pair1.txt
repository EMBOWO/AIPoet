Two loves I have of comfort and despair

Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
Which like two spirits do suggest me still
The better angel is a man right fair,
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.
To win me soon to hell, my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side,
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
And, whether that my angel be turn’d fiend,
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,
But being both from me both to each friend,
I guess one angel in another’s hell.
   Yet this shall I ne’er know, but live in doubt,
   Till my bad angel fire my good one out.

BREAK

Upon the Waning of a Summer’s Day

When Phoebus sinks behind the western hill,
And shadows stretch with slow and silent grace,
The murm’ring brook doth cease its merry trill,
And night descends with veil o’er Nature’s face.
O gentle hour, when lovers’ sighs take flight,
And whispered hopes hang trembling in the air,
Let not thy beauty vanish with the night,
But linger like a ghost, serene and fair.
Though Time, that thief, shall steal each golden hue,
And roses pale that once with blush were crowned,
Yet in my verse thy glory I renew,
Where thou, immortal, in my lines art bound.
   So shall thy light outlive the setting sun,
   And bloom anew when earthly days are done.
