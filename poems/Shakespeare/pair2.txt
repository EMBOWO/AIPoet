From you have I been absent in the spring

From you have I been absent in the spring,
When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim,
Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
Could make me any summer’s story tell,
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
Nor did I wonder at the lily’s white,
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
They were but sweet, but figures of delight
Drawn after you, – you pattern of all those.
    Yet seem’d it winter still, and, you away,
    As with your shadow I with these did play.

BREAK

Sonnet of the Restless Heart

O, what unrest within this breast doth bide,
When absence plants its thorn in love’s sweet bed.
Though time and space do cruelly divide,
My soul to thine by silken thread is led.
The stars may wheel along their ancient course,
And oceans roar 'twixt thee and my desire,
Yet none can break affection's gentle force,
Nor quench the heat of ever-burning fire.
Each night I dream thy voice, thy hand, thy eyes,
And wake to find but echoes in their stead.
Still shall I write 'neath these unpitying skies,
Till ink be spent, or I by sorrow dead.
    For if in verse thy presence I restore,
    Then parting hath no power—love lives the more.
