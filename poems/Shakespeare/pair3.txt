No longer mourn for me when I am dead

No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Give warning to the world that I am fled
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell; 
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
The hand that writ it; for I love you so, 
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, 
If thinking on me then should make you woe.
O, if (I say) you look upon this verse, 
When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse,
But let your love even with my life decay,
Lest the wise world should look into your moan, 
And mock you with me after I am gone.

To Time, That Tyrant Wears a Subtle Crown

O Time, thou sly and ever-creeping thief,
Thou steal’st the bloom from cheek and light from eye,
And in thy march leav’st joy as brief as grief,
Both born to fade beneath thy ruthless sky.
Thy hands, though soft, do wield a heavy blade,
That cuts through youth and trims the locks of pride;
No rose may in eternal blush be stayed,
Nor star in firmament forever bide.
Yet in defiance do I pen this line,
To hold thy shadow fast within my rhyme,
And make what dies seem evermore divine,
Preserved against the rot of rust and time.
So let thy sickle swing, thy hourglass fall—
My verse shall stand, though kingdoms turn to thrall.
