When forty winters shall besiege thy brow

When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,
Thy youth’s proud livery, so gazed on now,
Will be a tattered weed, of small worth held.
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies—
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days—
To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deserved thy beauty’s use 
If thou couldst answer "This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse", 
Proving his beauty by succession thine.
    This were to be new made when thou art old,
    And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.

When Silver Moon Doth Climb the Midnight Stair

When silver moon doth climb the midnight stair,
And stars in council light the vaulted sky,
Then doth my heart, unarmèd, soft and bare,
Release its truth with many a silent sigh.
For in the hush, where mortal noise is stilled,
My thoughts do steal to thee on silent wing,
And all the aching void with love is filled—
A sweet and melancholy blossoming.
Though fate hath cast thee far from where I dwell,
And Fortune sealed thy name in distant fate,
Yet in this dream, where shadows softly swell,
Thou art mine own, and I thy yearning mate.
    So speak, fair night, and keep thy secrets true,
    Till dawn unbinds the spell I wove for you.
