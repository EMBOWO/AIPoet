Those lips that Love’s own hand did make

Those lips that Love’s own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said “I hate”
To me that languished for her sake;
But when she saw my woeful state,
Straight in her heart did mercy come,
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
Was used in giving gentle doom,
And taught it thus anew to greet:
“I hate” she altered with an end
That followed it as gentle day
Doth follow night, who, like a fiend,
From heaven to hell is flown away.
   “I hate” from hate away she threw,
   And saved my life, saying “not you.”

Upon the Turning of the Autumn Leaf

Behold the leaf, once green with spring’s delight,
Now touched by gold and kissed with dying flame;
It falls, not with a cry, but soft in flight,
As though it knew it played a noble game.
So too must I, when seasons bid me part,
Let go with grace what once did bloom so fair,
And bear the frost that settles on the heart,
Though warmth be fled and perfume lost to air.
   Yet in decay lies beauty’s final breath,
   A whisper sweet that mocks the sting of death.
