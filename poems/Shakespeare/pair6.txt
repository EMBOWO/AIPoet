Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate

Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
Robbed others’ beds’ revenues of their rents.
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov’st those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
    If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
    By self-example mayst thou be denied.

The Mirror’s Tale

What face is this that doth in glass appear,
So like to mine, yet touched with lines of care?
The brow once smooth now furrows year by year,
And silver threads entwine the midnight hair.
O Time, thou painter rude with bristled brush,
Thou hast no mercy on the fairest frame;
Thou changest laughter's bloom to silence hush,
And rob'st the cheek of youth’s enkindled flame.
Yet still within these eyes a fire remains,
A soul unbent, though flesh may yield to age;
And though thy winds may batter love with pains,
My heart stands firm upon life’s storm-swept stage.
    For beauty’s not in bloom alone confessed—
    It lingers longest in the faithful breast.
